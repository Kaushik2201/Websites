                IE has played a very key role in my academic and co curricular growth. Always getting challenged with new problems and having the liberty to experiment and fall is something for which I'll be forever grateful to IE. It always felt like a home away from home as the seniors were so warm and welcoming. To current and new members, wish you luck to go onwards and upwards!

                    I think choosing IE as a club for me has the same significance as choosing NITK for college. Both decisions were against the grain, but their impact left a very positive mark in my development. IE was quintessential in my social and technical development. I will cherish all the friendships, trips, late night website work, dinners forever.</p>
